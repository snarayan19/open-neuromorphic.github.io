What connects us is the love for building tools that can be used in the neuromorphic community and we want to share ownership of this vision.
Open Neuromorphic (ONM) provides two things:
A curated list of software frameworks to make it easier to find the tool you need. A platform for your code.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://open-neuromorphic.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-neuromorphic.github.io/about/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://open-neuromorphic.github.io/about/ONM.png" alt="Featured image of post About" />This organisation is created by a loose collective of open source collaborators across academia, industry and individual contributors.

Charlotte Frenkel&amp;rsquo;s Laboratory - Delft University of Technology Charlotte Frenkel&amp;rsquo;s researh group aims at bridging the bottom-up (bio-inspired) and top-down (engineering-driven) design approaches toward neuromorphic intelligence, with a focus on spiking neural network processor design, embedded machine learning, and on-chip training algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Resources</title><link>https://open-neuromorphic.github.io/resources/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-neuromorphic.github.io/resources/</guid><description>SNN training frameworks for ML Open-source software to train spiking neural networks for ML tasks.
snnTorch snnTorch is a SNN training framework for machine learning applications. It is focused on gradient-based training of SNNs. It is based on PyTorch for GPU acceleration and gradient computation.
Norse Norse aims at exploiting the advantages of bio-inspired neural components, which are sparse and event-driven - a fundamental difference from artificial neural networks. Norse expands PyTorch with primitives for bio-inspired neural components, bringing you two advantages: a modern and proven infrastructure based on PyTorch and deep learning-compatible spiking neural network components.</description></item><item><title>Team</title><link>https://open-neuromorphic.github.io/team/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-neuromorphic.github.io/team/</guid><description>Founders Fabrizio Ottati Fabrizio Ottati is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electronics and Communications of Politecnico di Torino, under the supervision of professor Luciano Lavagno and professor Mario Roberto Casu.
His main interests are event-based cameras, digital IC design, spiking neural networks and piedmontese red wine. He is the maintainer of two open source projects in the field of neuromorphic computing, Tonic and Expelliarmus. You can find more information on his website.</description></item></channel></rss>
